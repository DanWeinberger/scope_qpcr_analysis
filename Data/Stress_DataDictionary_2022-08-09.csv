by Sheldon Cohen
",descriptive,"<div class=""rich-text-field-label""><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one’s life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. The PSS was designed for use in community samples with at least a junior high school education. The items are easy to understand, and the response alternatives are simple to grasp. Moreover, the questions are of a general nature and hence are relatively free of content specific to any subpopulation group. The questions in the PSS ask about feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, respondents are asked how often they felt a certain way.</span></p> <p><br />Evidence for Validity: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Higher PSS scores were associated with (for example): </span></p> <ul> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> failure to quits smoking</span></li> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">failure among diabetics to control blood sugar levels</span></li> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">greater vulnerability to stressful life-event-elicited-depressive symptoms</span></li> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">more colds</span></li> </ul> <p>Health status relationship to PSS: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Cohen et al. (1988) show correlations with PSS and: Stress Measures, Self- Reported Health and Health Services Measures, Health Behavior Measures, Smoking Status, Help Seeking Behavior.</span></p> <p><br />Temporal Nature: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Because levels of appraised stress should be influenced by daily hassles, major events, and changes in coping resources, predictive validity of the PSS is expected to fall off rapidly after four to eight weeks.</span></p> <p>Scoring: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">PSS scores are obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 & 4 = 0) to the four positively stated items (items 4, 5, 7, & 8) and then summing across all scale items. A short 4 item scale can be made from questions 2, 4, 5 and 10 of the PSS 10 item scale.</span></p> <p>Norm Groups: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">L. Harris Poll gathered information on 2,387 respondents in the U.S.</span></p></div>",,YYYY-MM-DD,,,,,,,,,,,
